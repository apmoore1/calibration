# calibration

1. Do multi experiments and include the Brier score and also the adaptive binning approach. See if minimising the calibration error also gets good accuracy. See also what is the minimum calibration score.
2. Have a look at how we can convert the Brier score into two scores where one is calibration and the other is refinement.
3. Using the new Calibration objective function if we minimise that do we get perfect calibration and if so what is the affect on accuracy and could we use that minimisation on the training does that minimise on the valiation set.


What we are trying to do:
1. Trying early stopping.
2. How good does calibration have to be?
